# Secure RAG Blog Series

This repository contains the code for the "Securing RAG Systems" blog series. It is organized into folders representing different stages of the application's security evolution.

## Repository Structure

-   📂 **`/base`**: The initial, insecure version of the RAG application. This serves as the starting point for the blog series, demonstrating a functional but vulnerable architecture.
-   📂 **`/secure-final`** *(Coming Soon)*: The hardened, production-ready version of the application, incorporating:
    -   Workload Identity Federation
    -   Document Level Access Control (DLAC)
    -   Content Disarm & Reconstruction (CDR)
    -   DLP and Input Sanitization

## Getting Started

To explore a specific version, navigate to its directory and follow the `README.md` instructions inside.

```bash
# Example: Setting up the base version
cd base
# Follow instructions in base/README.md
```
